local_seriesly
=====
This is a reimplementation of seriesly without Google's App Engine or Django. It lets you fetch the data of new episodes of your favourite tv show from tvrage.com and displays it as an html document. All those nifty little parts of the original seriesly like XMPP or RSS integration aren't implemented, since i don't need them.

This project uses the CSS and HTML stuff of the original Seriesly. (https://github.com/stefanw/seriesly)

==========
Installation
=====
To install local_seriesly just copy all files into a directory of your choice. The directory "./data" should be accessible through a web-server (e.g. Apache).

To configure your profiles edit the file "./show_id.cfg".

To find the right ids go to "http://services.tvrage.com/feeds/search.php?show=SHOW_NAME" (replace SHOW_NAME with the actual name of the show) and copy the listed id to the config file.

==========
Usage
=====
The script can just be executed using Python (python ./local_seriesly or just ./local_seriesly). It accepts three different flags:
  -f	fetch new data from tvrage.com and save it locally
  -g	generate html documents for the profiles in the config file
  -r	remove all working data of the script including the html documents and the fetched data

You can just execute the script by hand whenever you need it, or configure some cron jobs. In future releases wsgi support is planned, so the html documents are generated as soon as they are needed.

==========
Requirements
=====
To use local_seriesly you just need Python. A web server is more or less optional but useful if multiple users want to access local_seriesly.

local_seriesly is developed and tested under Python 2.7.2. But its possible to convert the scripts to Python 3 using 2to3.
